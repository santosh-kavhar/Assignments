Create a simple web application that displays information : ID, Name, Age, Gender, etc of multiple people (Use any frontend backend tool)
You can copy the source code for this web application from the internet. You aren't expected to write the code from scratch for the web application part. 
The website should have an option / form to add, delete and edit records. 
Use any database (mysql, postgres, mongodb,etc) to save these records. 
Write docker files to make this web application work end to end. 
Everything should be containerized (frontend, backend, database, etc) 
At run time, I should be able to add, edit and delete records and the same should reflect on the web application.
