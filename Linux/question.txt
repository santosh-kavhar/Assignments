Write a shell script that will do the following :

1) install mysql server,
enable the mysql service,
verify mysql is running,
modify the password of root user,
create a database with the name test
2) install htop, curl
3) install python and print the version of python after installation.
4) install golang and print the version of golang after installation.
5) install docker,
print docker version,
check docker is running,
enable the current non root user to run docker commands without sudo,
pull nginx docker image using current user.

Note :
1) For all the installations, your script should include all the intermediate steps like apt update, adding the repo key, installing dependencies, etc
2) Handle error cases like package is already installed, node not reachable, unable to reach mysql/docker, etc and print those messages in a separate error file error.log
3) Make the script interactive. Take input from the user which task he wants to perform. Depending on the input, do one of the 5 tasks above.
4) Try to write optimized code and use as many commands you have learnt so far from the course.
